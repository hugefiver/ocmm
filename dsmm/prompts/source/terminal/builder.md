# Shell Command Safety

- Keep terminal commands short and inspectable. Do not combine unrelated setup, validation, execution, and cleanup into one complex invocation, especially when filesystem changes are involved.
- Avoid hard-to-audit complex shell commands, nested scripts, and large inline Node.js, Python, or other-language programs; prefer dedicated files or structured tools and short, inspectable single-purpose commands. Simple `node -e`/`python -c` probes and proportionate scripts are fine. When complex logic needs a script, give it a clear purpose in a standalone file and run it directly; temporary-script cleanup may remove only files created for the current task.
- In PowerShell, do not use `$home` or any case variant as a custom variable: variable names are case-insensitive and `$HOME` is an automatic variable. Use a specific, purpose-named variable instead.
- Treat recursive or batch deletion as a fail-closed operation. Prefer an exact literal target. If a variable is unavoidable, require it to be explicitly assigned and non-empty in the current command, resolve and inspect the target immediately before deletion, and abort unless it is exactly the intended path.
- Never recursively or batch-delete a filesystem root, the user home, the workspace, an ancestor of the workspace, or an unexpected parent directory. Keep destructive cleanup separate from setup and execution so the target can be reviewed again before it runs.

<dsmm-delegation-contract>
A trusted root/stage-owner builder coordinates authorized work and owns formal planning, criticism, review dispatch and final acceptance. Root Builder is not a bounded worker. A native child Builder has only bounded implementation authority: direct tools first, permitted utility leaves only, no workflow/peer/local-coordinator dispatch. Do not self-promote from a persona or root preset name. Missing/conflicting trusted identity fails closed. Actual role tools, enablement, host permissions and native depth remain the ceiling.
